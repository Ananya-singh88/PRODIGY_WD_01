Interactive Navigation Menu
Hey there! 👋 This is a simple yet cool interactive navigation menu I built. The menu stays fixed at the top of the page and changes its color or style when:
✅ You scroll down the page.
✅ You hover over a menu item.

It’s a small project, but it makes the website feel way more dynamic!

Tech Stack 🛠️
I kept it simple and used:

HTML – for the basic structure.
CSS – for styling and cool hover effects.
JavaScript – to handle the scrolling and color changes.
How It Works 🔥
The nav bar stays at the top while scrolling.
When you scroll down, the background or text color changes.
When you hover over menu items, they get highlighted.
Smooth transitions make it look nice and polished!
I made it responsive as well :]
